Introduction

Public infrastructure is a critical component of urban life, influencing safety, convenience, and overall quality of living in communities worldwide. Issues such as broken streetlights, potholes, clogged drainage, and damaged sidewalks often disrupt everyday life and pose safety risks to residents. Traditional methods of reporting and addressing these problems are frequently slow, fragmented, and lack transparency, leading to delays and public dissatisfaction. The increasing urbanization and complexity of cities have driven the need for innovative, technology-driven solutions that enhance infrastructure maintenance and public service delivery (Gracias et al., 2023)

Globally, smart city initiatives have demonstrated the transformative potential of integrating automated systems and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into urban infrastructure management. Automated systems offer real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated prioritization of repairs, significantly reducing downtime and operational costs. By harnessing automated classification for categorization and prioritization of maintenance requests, municipalities can address infrastructure issues promptly while efficiently allocating resources (Dai et al., 2024). These innovations foster transparency by enabling residents to report concerns digitally, upload visual evidence, and track request statuses live, enhancing community engagement and local governance accountability (Bokrantz et al., 2019).

Despite these advancements, many communities still depend on manual and disjointed processes, underscoring the need for accessible, streamlined platforms that empower residents and local authorities alike. The Smart Neighborhood Maintenance Request and Response System aims to fill this gap by providing a web-based platform that integrates automated text classification (rule-based keyword matching) to automate issue categorization and prioritization. This system will enable residents to submit detailed maintenance requests, including photos and location specifics, while providing authorities with an administrative dashboard to monitor and respond efficiently. The study addresses a crucial need for innovation in local public infrastructure management, contributing to faster response times, improved transparency, and enhanced data-driven decision-making.

The importance of conducting this study lies in advancing digital solutions tailored to the operational realities of local government units and increasing community involvement in public maintenance reporting. By developing this system, the study emphasizes the thesis that leveraging automated classification and web technology in neighborhood infrastructure maintenance can substantially improve efficiency, responsiveness, and resident satisfaction paving the way for smarter, safer, and more resilient communities.

Purpose and Description

The purpose of this study is to design and prototype a Smart Neighborhood Maintenance Request and Response System that leverages automated text classification (rule-based keyword matching) to modernize the reporting, categorization, and prioritization of public infrastructure issues. This system is intended to strengthen communication and transparency between residents and local authorities, accelerate response times, and support data-driven decisions for more efficient resource allocation.

This study is a prototype-based system development research project, focusing on the creation and pilot testing of a web-based platform. The platform enables residents to submit maintenance requests with photos, descriptions, and location details, while local officials use an administrative dashboard to monitor, classify, and manage these requests. Automated classification (rule-based keyword matching) automates categorization and prioritization, reducing manual workloads for staff while improving service delivery.

In summary, this research seeks to demonstrate an innovative approach to neighborhood infrastructure maintenance by combining smart automation, data-driven analytics, and community engagement. The study will provide a working prototype as proof-of-concept, showcasing how automated classification and web technologies can transform traditional maintenance reporting processes and improve the quality of life and safety in local communities.

Objectives

This study is guided by the goal to design, develop, and evaluate a prototype Smart Neighborhood Maintenance Request and Response System that integrates automated text classification (rule-based keyword matching), web-based resident reporting, and administrative dashboards for efficient public infrastructure maintenance.

Specifically, it aims to:

1. Develop a web-based reporting platform where residents can submit maintenance requests for public infrastructure issues, including descriptions, photos, and location details.

2. Integrate automated text classification (rule-based keyword matching) to automatically categorize and prioritize maintenance requests, reducing manual workload for local government staff.

3. Implement a real-time request tracking feature that enables residents to monitor the status and progress of their submitted maintenance requests.

4. Create an administrative dashboard for barangay or city staff to view, manage, update, and prioritize maintenance requests based on automated classification suggestions and issue severity.

5. Generate analytics and visualizations summarizing reported issues, response times, and maintenance outcomes to support data-driven decision-making by local authorities.

6. Facilitate community engagement by allowing residents to provide feedback on completed maintenance work and interact with the system through user-friendly features.

7. Demonstrate the system's effectiveness and usability through a pilot implementation focusing on selected categories of neighborhood infrastructure issues.

Scope and Limitation

Scope

This research focuses on the design, development, and pilot testing of a prototype Smart Neighborhood Maintenance Request and Response System with the following core components:

● A web-based platform with two roles:

○ Resident role: submit maintenance requests with descriptions, photos, and location details.

○ Administrative staff role: view, categorize, prioritize, and update the status of maintenance requests.

● Automated text classification module (rule-based keyword matching) for automatic categorization and prioritization of public infrastructure issues such as broken streetlights, potholes, clogged drainage, and damaged sidewalks.

● Real-time request tracking and email notification features to enhance communication and transparency.

● An administrative dashboard providing analytics and visualization for reported issues, response times, and resource allocation.

● Pilot implementation focusing on selected categories of neighborhood infrastructure issues for evaluation of feasibility and usability.

Limitations

This study is limited to the design, development, and evaluation of a Smart Neighborhood Maintenance Request and Response System prototype, with the following constraints:

● The rule-based classification system relies on predefined keyword lists that may not capture all variations of issue descriptions, potentially leading to limited accuracy in automatic issue categorization and prioritization. The system currently only processes text descriptions and does not analyze uploaded images for classification.

● The system is web-based only, without dedicated mobile app or offline functionality for field staff.

● Notifications are limited initially to email, with SMS and push notifications planned for future development.

● The system supports only selected categories of public infrastructure issues (e.g., streetlights, potholes, drainage, sidewalks).

● The pilot implementation is constrained to a small geographic area and limited user base for testing and demonstration purposes.

● Advanced features such as IoT sensor integration, predictive maintenance, and full security hardening are outside the scope of this semester's development and reserved for later phases.

● The system does not integrate with existing municipal maintenance workflows or databases in this initial phase.
